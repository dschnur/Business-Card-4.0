# Business-Card-4.0
Video Game Business Card

This business card uses an ATTiny85 programmed by an Arduino AVR via the pin header.
It uses the Open Source repository from Tiny Joypad for the software.
The screen can be just about any 128x64 SSD1306 device.  I use the .94" one to keep costs per unit down, but I've used larger.
The button top is designed in OpenScad and 3D printed.
